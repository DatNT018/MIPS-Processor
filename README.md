# Single Cycle Core MIPS

This repo is an Assignment project undertaken as part of the Digital System Design module, focusing on the implementation of a single cycle MIPS processor written Verilog on Altera Board (DE2-115). This project provides a practical understanding of Computer Architecture and their implementation within an FPGA environment.
